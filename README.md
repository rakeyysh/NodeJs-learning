# NodeJs-learning

✅ Why Express.js?
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides:

Built-in routing system.

Easy use of middleware (e.g., body-parser, authentication, logging).

Cleaner syntax.

Helps in organizing code into files and modules.

Makes REST API development fast and efficient.

Supports integration with templating engines (like EJS, Pug).

Built-in support for static files, status codes, error handling.



In Node.js, we manually create a single server using the http module, and then we route incoming requests to different handlers based on the request method and the URL path. This is usually done using nested if-else or switch statements, which makes the code less readable and harder to maintain as the app grows. That’s why we use Express.js — it simplifies routing with cleaner syntax, supports multiple HTTP methods easily, and allows us to build modular and maintainable code. Also, Express helps reduce the need to manually import and configure multiple utility modules (like body parsers, routers, etc.), making development faster and more efficient.
